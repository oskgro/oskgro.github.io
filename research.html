            <p>Using our research tool PassBeat, we want to conduct a field study and collect data in order to answer the following question:</p>
            <blockquote>Are rhythm-based passwords easier to remember than conventional, text-based passwords?</blockquote>
            <p>As discussed in section <a href="rhythm-based-authentication.html"><i>Why rhythm-based authentication?</i></a>, conventional text-based passwords have many flaws. In particular, secure text-based passwords are often difficult to remember and cumbersome to use on mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we propose another option: Rhythm-based authentication. However, to be a real alternative, rhythm-based password have to be user friendly. This includes, among other criteria, that they have to be easy to remember.</p>
            <p>Research suggests, that rhythm-based passwords might be easier to remember as users are more likely to have an emotional connection to a music piece than to letters or numbers. Therefore, the goal of our study is to determine whether the possible emotional connection to music increases the retentiveness of rhythm-based passwords in comparison to text-based passwords.</p>
            <h3>Our Hypothesis:</h3>
            <p>The login-success-rate of participants using rhythm-based passwords will be higher than the login-success-rate of participants using text-based passwords of comparable security level.</p>
