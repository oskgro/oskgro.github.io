            <h1 class="major">Future Work</h1>
            <p>Since the time scope of our project was quite limited, there are several points that could be further elaborated in future work:</p>
            <h3>Study on Long Term Recollection Rhythm-based Password</h3>
            <p>
                Since passwords that are seldom used are harder to remember, they are often less secure. To avoid forgetting the password, users might write it down, use simpler a password or use a password that is already used for another account. Therefore, it would be interesting whether users can remember secure rhythm-based passwords better than text-based passwords of comparable security level over longer periods of time.<br>
                In order to answer this question, we propose to conduct a field study using our research tool examining password recollection of rhythm- and text-based passwords when they have not been used for several weeks or even months. Conducting this long term study was not possible due to the tight time scope of our project.
            </p>
            <h3>Study on Commonly Used Rhythm-based Passwords</h3>
            <p>
                By adding an additional feature to our developed research tool which gives users the option to voluntarily submit their rhythm-based passwords after setup, our tool could also be used to gain insights on what rhythms users choose as passwords.<br>
                This opens up the possibility of conducting a study to find out what the most common rhythm-based passwords are – i.e. finding the rhythm-based equivalent to "password1" – and determining whether users, on average, choose more secure rhythm-based passwords than text-based passwords.
            </p>
            <h3>Extend Tool by Survey Functionality</h3>
            <p>Our research tool could also be extended by a survey functionality. This would allow researchers to easily conduct surveys e.g. on convenience, usability, perceived security of rhythm-based passwords during the field studies. Since the tool is already installed on the participants phones it would be a very convenient way for the participants to answer surveys and also give them the freedom to answer surveys on their phone whenever it fits into their time schedule.</p>
