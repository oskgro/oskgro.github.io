            <h3>Purpose of PassBeat</h3>
            <p>The purpose of PassBeat is to test the users' ability to remember rhythm-based authenitcation methods as compared to text-based passwords. Many studies have suggested that rhythms, melodies and music are relatively easy for humans to rememeber, and some studies also suggest that text-based passwords are relatively difficult to remember. Furthermore, the ability to remember the latter decreases as its security increases.</p>
            <p>The app will serve as a tool when conducting field studies. The idea is that the app should serve this purpose automatically once downloaded on a user's smartphone, logging any data that is deemed interesting in regard to the research questions.</p>

            <h3>How to use PassBeat</h3>
            <h4>Setting a password</h4>
            <img src="images/phone_setup_hd.png" alt="Setup prototype" style="height:600px;max-width:500px;width: expression(this.width > 500 ? 500: true);"/>
            <p>Upon entering the setup-view, the user it prompted to tap a rhythm of their choice that will serve as authentication in the app. The user taps the same rhythm five times, and if all five inputs are similar enough an average will be calculated and saved. The icon at the bottom allows the user to redo the last input.</p>
            <h4>Logging in</h4>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/PassBeat-Prototype.svg" alt="PassBeat Prototype" /></span> <!-- TODO: change images to current layout! -->
            <p>In the login-view the user can tap their rhythm, if properly set up, to enter the app. The button is animated to give slight visual feedback when tapped and haptic feedback will be given unless it has been muted using the icon in the bottom right corner. The level of feedback the user gets is supposed to represent what is generally available.</p>
            <p>By pressing the "Forgotten your rhythm?"-text, the user can reset their rhythm if they have forgotten it.</p>

            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Flowchart.svg" alt="flowchart of the authentication process" /></span>

            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/diagram_time.png" alt="PassBeat vector representation" /></span>
            <p>When a user enters their PassBeat authentication code the length of each press and the pauses between them are save measured in milliseconds and saved in a vector. This means that every other value in the resulting vector represents the length of a press, and every other value represents the length of a pause.</p>
            <p>When the user then tries to authenticate themselves, the user input is compared to the stored rhythm in order to caluclate an error. The error is then compared to the threshold. A few different ways to calculate the error were tested, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Squared Mean Percentage Error.</p>
            <p>In the end Squared Mean Percentage Error was chosen as the method for calculating the error as we found it to have the most significant differences in error between the correct rhythm and a similar, but wrong, rhythm. The app will, of course, not even start to compare the passwords unless they are of the same length and if the error of a single tap is too large the final error will be overlooked and access denied.</p>
            <h3>Evaluation of the App</h3>
            <h4>Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics</h4>
            <p>As a part of the evaluation, Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics will be used. Due to the limited scope of the project, some heuristics are more relevant than others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visibility of system status: </strong>The large text at the top of each page serves as a way to show the status of the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Match between system and the real world: </strong>We tried to use short texts or phrases instead of icons in order to increase the understanding, unless the meaning of an icon is obvious.</li>
                <li><strong>User control and freedom: </strong>Since the project is about authentication, the freedom has to be limited. But within this limitation the user is free to enter any view possible at that time.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency and standards: </strong>The app uses icons that are commonly used and whose meaning is unambiguous. The yellow input-button looks the same and has the same behaviour on all pages where it is present.</li>
                <li><strong>Error prevention: </strong>Due to the app-environment there is relatively little room for user-caused errors, unlike on websites. Error prevention has, however, been checked often throughout the development. </li>
                <li><strong>Recognition rather than recall: </strong>Plenty of instructions are given to the user in each view and all options are always present on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use: </strong>Not really relevant to the project or its scope.</li>
                <li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design: </strong>We have tried to keep the App's design as minimalistic as possible using as few elements as possible, and only three colours: black, white and yellow. The design is supposed to emphasize the yellow input-button in order to increase understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Helps users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors: </strong>Not really relevant to the scope of the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Help and documentation: </strong>The user is given the option to read a short "About"-section in the app and is also invited to this website for more information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The level of feedback given will be familiar to the user and will neither confuse nor overwhelm the user.</li>
                <li>A simple design and a limited, but well thought out, choice of colours helps emphasize the important elements in the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <li>Unless the user is careful they can still be subject to things that lower their integrity, such as shoulder-surfing.</li>
            <li>Limited visual and auditory feedback might worsen a user's ability to remember their secret rhythm.</li>
