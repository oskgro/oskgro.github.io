            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The level of feedback given will be familiar to the user and will neither confuse nor overwhelm the user.</li>
                <li>A simple design and a limited, but well thought out, choice of colours helps emphasize the important elements in the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unless the user is careful they can still be subject to things that lower their integrity, such as shoulder-surfing.</li>
                <li>Limited visual and auditory feedback might worsen a user's ability to remember their secret rhythm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>
            <p>We analysed the app based on Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, due to the scope of the project some heuristics are more relevant than others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visibility of system status: </strong>The large text at the top of each page serves as a way to show the status of the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Match between system and the real world: </strong>We tried to use short texts or phrases instead of icons in order to increase the understanding, unless the meaning of an icon is obvious.</li>
                <li><strong>User control and freedom: </strong>Since the project is about authentication, the freedom has to be limited. But within this limitation the user is free to enter any view possible at that time.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency and standards: </strong>The app uses icons that are commonly used and whose meaning is unambiguous. The yellow input-button looks the same and has the same behaviour on all pages where it is present.</li>
                <li><strong>Error prevention: </strong>Due to the app-environment there is relatively little room for user-caused errors, unlike on websites. Error prevention has, however, been checked often throughout the development. </li>
                <li><strong>Recognition rather than recall: </strong>Plenty of instructions are given to the user in each view and all options are always present on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use: </strong>Not really relevant to the project or its scope.</li>
                <li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design: </strong>We have tried to keep the App's design as minimalistic as possible using as few elements as possible, and only three colours: black, white and yellow. The design is supposed to emphasize the yellow input-button in order to increase understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Helps users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors: </strong>Not really relevant to the scope of the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Help and documentation: </strong>The user is given the option to read a short "About"-section in the app and is also invited to this website for more information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>One thing we have heard multiple times in feedback is that this kind of authenitcation would not suit people who are tone-deaf or has little sense of music. This is highly relevant feedback and also allowing normal text-based passwords would be a way to solve this problem. However, this solution raises problems in the potential usage of rhythm-based passwords as people, when given the option, might opt for text-based passwords due to their familiarity with it. Why learn a whole new type of password when you can stick with what you are used to?</p>
            <p>The app has also been critiqued in that shoulder-surfing still is possible despite the fact that this, in the beginning, was one of the issues that the app was going to solve. The reason why this hasn't been addressed to a significant extent is mainly due to the fact that the more secure version of the early prototypes was dropped. However, in our opinion the app is still at least equally secure as normal passwords would be, if not more so. It is still possible for the user to cover the screen with one hand while entering their rhythm with the other, or even hold the smartphone behind their back.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <h3>TODO:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>statistical evaluation of results</li>
                <li>conclusion</li>
                <li>confidence in conclusions</li>
